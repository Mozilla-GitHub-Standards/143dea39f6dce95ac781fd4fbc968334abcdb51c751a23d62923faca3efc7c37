This repository contains a Mercurial extension (and supplementary libraries)
that override hg commit to run clang-format as a hook.

To activate the extension, place the following in your .hgrc:

  [extensions]
  clang-format = /path/to/version-control-tools/hgext/clang-format

Once activated, run `hg help clang-format` for information about this extension.

Mercurial hooks are much harder because
With the precommit hook, as the node arg isn't part of the method profile,
we don't know which files are going to be modified.

With the pretxncommit hook, we are able to retrieve the list of modified/added
 files using repo[node].changeset()[3].
However, once the changes have been done, as the repo is locked, we cannot add
back the changes in the repo.
